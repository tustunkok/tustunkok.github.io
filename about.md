Hi. My name is Tolga Üstünkök. I have a computer engineering degree from Atılım University, Turkey. I'm mostly interested in embedded systems and control systems. However, recent trends change my aims towards machine learning and neural networks. I am continuing my Master's study in Software Engineering at Atılım University since February, 2018.

This blog is prepared for publish the subjects that I found interesting or worth to write about. The content will consist of mostly technical posts.
