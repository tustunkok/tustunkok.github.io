I am a research assistant of Software Engineering Department at Atılım University, Turkey. I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Atılım University in 2017. I am continuing my Master's study in Software Engineering with Murat Karakaya. Between September 2017 and February 2018, I worked as a software engineer at Yalabık Mühendislik. My primary research interests are deep learning, machine learning, optimization techniques, and computer vision.

I am a semi professional pianist and a Hacettepe University Parttime Guitar Department graduate (2009). I am a member of TED Symphony Orchestra as a tubist since 2007.
