Hello! I'm **Tolga Üstünkök** — a DevOps Engineer at **Türkiye İş Bankası**, with a strong foundation in both **Computer Engineering** (undergraduate) and **Software Engineering** (graduate).  

My current professional focus lies in **monitoring systems** and **anomaly detection in time-series system metrics**, where I bring both practical experience and a passion for precision. I specialize in designing scalable, reliable observability architectures that help detect and resolve issues proactively.

## Background & Research

Previously, I was active in **computer vision research**, which continues to influence how I approach complex problems — blending mathematical rigor with software intuition. This technical diversity supports my day-to-day DevOps work, especially when modeling anomalies or building alerting pipelines.

## Tech Stack & Interests

- **Monitoring & Observability**: Grafana, Telegraf, ELK, OpenTelemetry, Apache NiFi
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible
- **Programming**: Python, Bash, Go
- **Anomaly Detection**: Time-series modeling, rule-based and statistical systems

## Beyond Engineering

I'm also a **semi-professional pianist** and a **Hacettepe University Part-time Guitar Department graduate (2009)**. Music has been a lifelong passion and a counterbalance to my technical career — helping me stay creative, focused, and grounded.
